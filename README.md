# Drink Dispenser

The drink dispenser provides drinks to consumers who make the necessary selections. For the project, we have an option to select four drinks of Blue, Magenta, Red, and Green color. The indicator, present above every dispenser, changes its color from Red to Green while a drink is being poured. The code is developed with the graphics library of C programming (graphics.h).
