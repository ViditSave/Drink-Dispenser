# Drink Dispenser

A drink dispenser is a machine that provides drinks to the consumers after a selection is made. For the project we have selection of four drinks of color Blue, Magenta, Red and Green. An indicator is shown above every dispenser which is changed from Red to Green if the drink must be dispensed.
